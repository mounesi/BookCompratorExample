To run the provided Java code on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can verify by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:
bash
Copy code
- java -version
- javac -version
If both commands produce version numbers, you have Java and the Java compiler installed.
If you don't have JDK installed, download and install it from the official Oracle website or adopt an OpenJDK distribution like AdoptOpenJDK.
Create the Java Files:

Create a new directory/folder on your machine for this example, e.g., BookComparatorExample.
Within that folder, create the following files and copy the corresponding code into them:
- Book.java (for the Book class)
- BookComparator.java (for the BookComparator class)
- ComparatorExample.java (for the main class that includes the main method)

Compile the Java Files:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory you created (BookComparatorExample).
Compile the Java files using the following command:
- javac *.java
This command will compile all Java files in the current directory and produce bytecode files (.class files).

Run the Program:

In the terminal or command prompt, execute the ComparatorExample class using the java command:
- java ComparatorExample
You should see the output as previously mentioned.
Cleanup (optional):




After running the program, you can delete the generated .class files to clean up the directory. The original .java files are all you need to keep if you want to modify or run the program again in the future.
